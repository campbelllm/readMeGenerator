# Homework Week 9 - README Generator

## Description:

Using inquirer, a series of prompts are used to ask the user questions about their repo. Their inputs are then taken and used to create a well formated README file for them to use. The users GitHub username is asked for to obtain the users profile picture and email, using Axios, which is added to the questions section of the file.
